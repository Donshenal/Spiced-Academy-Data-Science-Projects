<div align="justify">This repository contains the projects I completed during a Data Science Bootcamp at SPICED Academy from September to December 2021. These are not finalized versions, yet. I am continously refactoring, correcting and updating the codes during 
January, 2022.</div>

## 01. Visual Data Analysis - Animated Scatterplot

<div align="justify">This animated scatterplot visualizes the changes of countries' fertility rate, life expectancy and population between 1960 and 2015. The sizes of the scatters represents the population of each country, the colours shows in which continent they can be found.</div><br>

The notebook with detailed comments and plotly interactivy is also available on [Jupyter Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lzhl7rgZrw2-1RxhsBOEjXzb86fvKp2n).<br>

Data source: [Gapminder Foundation](https://www.gapminder.org/data/).<br>
