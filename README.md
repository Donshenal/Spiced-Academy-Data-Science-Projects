<div align="justify">This repository contains the projects I completed during a Data Science Bootcamp at SPICED Academy from September to December 2021. These are not finalized versions, yet. I am continously refactoring, correcting and updating the codes during 
January, 2022.</div>

## 01. Visual Data Analysis - Animated Scatterplot

![animation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/orosz-attila/Spiced-Academy-Data-Science-Projects/master/01_visual_data_analysis_animated_scatterplot/images/animation.gif)

<div align="justify">This animated scatterplot visualizes the changes of countries' fertility rate, life expactancy and population between 1960 and 2015. The sizes of the scatters represents the population of each country, the colours shows in which continent they can be found.</div><br>

The notebook with detailed comments and plotly interactivy is also available on [Jupyter Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lzhl7rgZrw2-1RxhsBOEjXzb86fvKp2n).<br>

Data source: [Gapminder Foundation](https://www.gapminder.org/data/).<br>

## 12. Final Project - Covid-19 Dashboard

<div align="justify">As a final project, I built an interactive dashboard with daily updates, displaying 23 data categories on a scatter world map, the trends of the Covid-19 pandemic by countries, with the option of comparing countries in multiple user-selected data categories in line- and barcharts.</div><br>

The dashboard is deployed with Streamlit and can be found [here](https://share.streamlit.io/orosz-attila/covid-19-dashboard/main).
