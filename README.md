## 12. Final Project - Covid-19 Dashboard

<div align="justify">As a final project, I built an interactive dashboard with daily updates, displaying 23 data categories on a scatter world map, the trends of the Covid-19 pandemic by countries, with the option of comparing countries in multiple user-selected data categories in line- and barcharts.<br><br>
