## 08. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC): Predicting and simulating customer behaviour in a supermarket.

The goal of this project was predicting and visualizing customer behaviour between departments/aisles in a supermarket, applying Markov Chain modeling and Monte-Carlo simulation.     

The project involved the following tasks:

1. EDA, Data Wrangling
2. Calculating Transition Probabilities between aisles
3. Implementing a Customer Class
4. Running MCMC (Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo) simulation for a single class customer 
5. Extending the simulation to multiple customers
6. Animation/Visualization
